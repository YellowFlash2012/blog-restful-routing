Project title: Tenten's Blog

Project description: end-to-end blog flask app to record some random thoughts and musings.

Front end stack: html, css, bootstrap

Backend stack: flask and postgresql

Key learning points:
1- setting the .env file was challenging before it was easy. But I now know how to do it right the first time.
2- it's not worth it to waste time on SQLLite. Something like postgresql is the way to go every single time.
3- How to structure my project according to the package model.
4- How to use werkzeug.security to configure password hashing
